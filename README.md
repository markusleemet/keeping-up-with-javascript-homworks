# Vehicle sharing application

This is a web application that allows users to share a different kinds of vehicles. Every user can add his/her vehicles to the application that other users can rent out.

As a user of the application, I want to be able to add my own vehicle to the application so that other users could rent it.

As a user, while adding a vehicle to the application, I want to be able to select the type of vehicle(car, bike, scooter, plane) and fill in relevant information about that vehicle type.

As an admin, I want that all vehicles have base information(price per hour, suitable for X persons, maximum distance without charging/fueling), and every vehicle type also has specific information to give the user the best possible overview.
